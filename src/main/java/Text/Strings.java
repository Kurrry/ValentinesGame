                \nFor our first valentine's day I wanted to make you something special.
                You have given me so much over the past 2 years and having you by my side is the gift
                of a life time. I can't wait to be yours forever and live a happy life together.
                You are beyond special to me, my Katie pie. I hope you enjoy this little text adventure.
